<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I noticed that a lot of people who document the Sea of Thieves lore were writing down the text of the books by hand, so I created this script to allow you to automate this by taking screenshots.

Important notes:
* The script use CPU to detect text, speed may differ from a system to another
* Don't run the same images multiple times if you find mistakes, the results will be the same just correct them by hand
* What I've tested: dont work with Rose/Gold Hoarders/Larinna police, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/hxr7BRB.jpeg">see this image</a>
* All lore books and dialogue works correctly make sure you don't have any text on your screenshots like island popup or players names

There is an end of execution beep once the script has finished running, this allows you to do something else.
