## About The Project

I noticed that many people documenting the lore of Sea of Thieves were writing the text in-game by hand, I created this script to allow you to automate this by taking only simple screenshots.

Important notes:
* The script uses the CPU to detect the text, speed may vary depending on your components.
* Don't run the same images multiple times if you find mistakes, the results will be the same just correct them by hand.
* What I've tested: this specific font doesn't work with the script (font used mainly on Larinna scrolls), <a href="https://i.imgur.com/hxr7BRB.jpeg">see this image</a>.
* All lore books and dialogues should work properly. Make sure your screenshots are clean, avoid island popups or player names.

There is an end of execution beep once the script has finished running, this allows you to do something else.

This script can be used easily in a shell, you don't need to use an IDE.

* Here you can type:
```sh
python main.py
```
The script will install all necessary modules and run the script.
You can see the results in the console and in the `/results` folder.
